Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools
for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less
pain. The lessons below were adapted to give you an introduction to Python.


## Data

Data for this lesson is from the Portal Project Teaching Database -
[available on FigShare](https://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459).

Specifically, the data files we use in these lessons are:

- [surveys.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172)
- [species.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299483)
- [surveys_complete.csv](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/python-ecology-lesson/raw/gh-pages/data_output/surveys_complete.csv)

## Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow.
*These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but working
through this lesson requires working copies of the software described below.
To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to install everything
*before* working through this lesson.

Participants are required to abide by Data Carpentry's
[Code of Conduct](http://www.datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/).
